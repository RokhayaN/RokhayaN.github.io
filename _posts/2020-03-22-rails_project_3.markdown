Half way through . Ruby on rails  is such a beautiful framework .Quick ,efficient .

Hi ,There 

From Mvc, Routes to Database this project was so far the most challenging through my coding journey.
Happily , Through after every difficulty come an ease . The Frustation along with the desir to see everything runnig 
beautifully .Keep this sister motivate . Plus can we talk about the amount of clarity and "that makes sense" that come with completing such a project . The best way of learning is by doing it, implementing it .

A quick reminder about ressource ,it behave like magic by drawing all our routes but a better understanding might 
help us understand that there is no magic in programming everything is explainable .

What is ressource in rails ?


"Any object that you want users to be able to access via URI and perform CRUD (or some subset thereof) operations on can be thought of as a resource. In the Rails sense, it is generally a database table which is represented by a model, and acted on through a controller.

For example, you might have a User resource (with a users table in your DB). This is represented by a User model, is mapped to users_controller with map.resources :users (which then generates routes like /users (a collection of User resources) and /users/1 (a specific User resource).

You act upon those resources by using the appropriate HTTP method when making calls to those resources. POST to the resource collection (/users) creates a new record; GET retrieves a list of resources (/users) or a specific user (/users/1). PUT updates a specific user (/users/1/), and DELETE destroys that user. The URLs are the same, but the result (and controller action) may be different based on the HTTP verb. The idea, though is that /users/1 always means "I'm interacting with the User that has ID #1", regardless of the action"
