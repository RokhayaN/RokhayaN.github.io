Building cool projects is one of the most exciting parts of learning to code. When you just getting started on your coding journey, you might come up with an amazing idea and want to immediately begin figuring out how to make it real.

But as you expand your skillset and start to build projects that you’re planning to actually launch into the world to be used by real people, it’s important to consider how your project is going to look and function from a user’s perspective.

 Here are some best practices you should always have in mind:
 
* Use consistent indentation. There is no right or wrong indentation that everyone should follow. ...
* Follow the DRY Principle. ...
* Avoid Deep Nesting. ...
* Limit line length. ...
* File and folder structure. ...
* Naming conventions. ...
* Keep the code simple.

Happy coding y'all
