###  A.  A quick bio

 Welcome to my blog ! My name is Rokhaya Ndiaye .
 I m currently a student of Flatiron School / Online Software Engineering .
 This is my first ever written blog as it happen to be my first programming project.
 
###  B. Project Overview / Expections / challenges / Solutions 

*I will described this first project as a dive in for me . It definetly passed my expectations 
in terms of content , work loads and challenges . Almost everything that we learned this past
weeks was put together in this project . 
 I have now a clear understanding of the work loads and time that need to be put on the table to sucessfully
 complete such a curicullum .

 The challenge was more of implementing ,organizing and following up with a new learning pattern .
 For example , we are used to the IDE Learn now having to
*  create a repo
* git clone "git/link"
* git add .
* git commit -m"file"
* git push

	
And doing it very often to save your progress and keep in track of your codes .

As challenging as that project could look at first sight ; i love that it gave me that clear understanding of
how things work . Of course we had an overview with the past labs but this project is comparable to a puzzle .
while the pieces of that puzzle are our previous labs .

Finally that satisfying feeling when you completed it ,hit that run button an watch the magic happens .

Happy Coding y'All
